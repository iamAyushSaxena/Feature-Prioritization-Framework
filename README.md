# 🚀 Feature Prioritization Framework with A/B Test Simulation

## 📋 Project Overview

A comprehensive, data-driven product management framework that demonstrates systematic feature prioritization using the RICE methodology and validates recommendations through statistical A/B testing simulation. Built to showcase real-world PM skills including prioritization, data analysis, statistical reasoning, and stakeholder communication.

### **Problem Statement**

Product teams face the critical challenge of deciding which features to build when engineering resources are limited. Without a systematic approach, decisions are often opinion-based rather than data-driven, leading to:
- Wasted engineering effort on low-impact features
- Missed revenue opportunities
- Unclear prioritization criteria
- Lack of statistical validation

This project simulates a real-world PM scenario for a food delivery platform with 500K monthly active users, systematically evaluating 15 feature ideas and validating the top recommendation through rigorous A/B testing.
